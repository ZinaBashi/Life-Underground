            <p>
            	Thank you for taking the time to experience this simulation. The tracks are best experienced in the context of the subway, but until we can safely do so, you may also access the full Uptown N playlist at your leisure, found on the project page.

Remember, the narratives you were listening to are thoughts and lived experiences, crowdsourced from past subway riders just like you. If you would like to contribute to this project with a story, thought, or expression of your own, leave a voicemail at <br> <br>
