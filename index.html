<p> In light of the circumstances brought on by COVID-19, it is imperative that many of us (non-essential workers) stay in and avoid crowded spaces like the subway. Sometimes it takes a time like this - as we begin to miss the live music on the platforms, odd sights on the train cars, and the all too familiar voice of the train announcement - to realize what a big part of our life the subway plays. Until it is safe to hop back on, this site provides you with an audio visual experience that is meant to simulate a New Yorkerâ€™s commute, as you navigate the tunnels while listening to Life Underground.
<br>
<br>
This audio visual simulation is best experienced in full screen, and with headphones.
